**序**
对于我这个技术小小白，要在这里留下自己的踪迹是多么困难的事啊，幸亏自己还存有对“美”的憧憬，加上朋友的鼓舞，最终，克服了重重困难，爬山涉水，虽然现在只是在山脚下...

Look back the hard start, I have read more than twenty of blogs about how to build the blog in github, but they are always too "simply" for me, just a few blog helped me... at last, i found that I have to read the technical reports, read it line by line, even thounds of line, there are always have some useful message to you, then find it and read it, learn it by heart! This is the secret! At last i have found it! Bless me! I eventurally take over this obstacle!

In addition, i start the note by myself, it will include all the details! If i can do it, then you can do it too!
finally ,fogive me poor english...

建立此博客的目的：
    虽然很想写日记，但从没“狠”下心来过，所以还是先从这里开始我的博客之旅...好吧，我不带走一片云彩，只想留下一点自己的踪迹...
    记录下每天的生活，不至于回忆起来，一片空白...
